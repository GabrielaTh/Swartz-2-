# Discover the terminal

It's time to discover the terminal and learn how to handle basic manipulations.

# Objectifs

Discover which command line will allow you to:

- know exactly where you are;
- display the contents of a directory;
- create a directory;
- create a file;
- rename that file;

If you do not know, it's time to ask your new BFF: Google! In fact, at BeCode, before asking your neighbor, you ask the Internet first!
