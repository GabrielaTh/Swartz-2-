# Master Google

Here are a few tips to improve your Googling skill:

## Keep it simple
Google is smart.  Only use keywords and drop words that are less than 3 characters.

## Search in English

## Use quotes for exact-word searching
The first thing to do when investigating an unknown error message, is to throw it at Google using quotes. It basically means : "Find pages containing these EXACT words".  
For example:

```
"Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/to/geeklog/public_html/config.php:581) in /path/to/geeklog/public_html/system/lib-sessions.php on line 180"
```

I copy/paste it in Google and only keep the non-specific part of the message. I then wrap it in quotes to say "search exactly this": 

```"Cannot modify header information – headers already sent by"```

## Search on a particular site
Prepend your search phrase by  `site :` followed by the domain name. 
For instance, I could use the previous search, but limit it to the website stackoverflow.com

```
site:stackoverflow.com "Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by"
```

## Who links to my site ?

```
link:tonsite.be
```

## Find me similar sites ?

```
related:becode.org

```

## Use `OR` and `AND` operators
```
chocolate OR white chocolate
```

## Start with the technology you're working on to limit the results to the language you are using

```
php array push  
javascript array push  
sql joint tutorial  
```

## Learning a new technology ? Look for a tutorial.
Tutorials are the most efficient ways to understand quickly the why and how of a new technology.

```
gulp tutorial     
php upload tutorial  
```

## Refine your search by adding keywords progressively.


```
php array
php array push
php array splice
```

## Think "langage pro"

Use professional-level language : you'll find more useful content. Think SEO.

`find a dev job in bxl` —> `web developer job offers Brussels`

## Stick to your sources
For instance, you'll quickly find out that mysql documentation SUCKS big time, but PHP's manual is a true bounty. So is jQuery's. stackoverflow.com is awesome for specific problems.

```
site:stackoverflow.com "array push at specific index"
```

## The wildcard
"wildcard" = "any character in this location".
Very useful to find the lyrics of a song. :-)

```
Come * right now * me
```
