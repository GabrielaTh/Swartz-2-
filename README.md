## [Respect of schedules: what about delays and absences?](https://github.com/becodeorg/BeCode/blob/master/educationalcontract.md#respect-of-schedules-what-about-delays-and-absences)

In case of delay, absence ou early departure (whether it's planned or not at all), warn us using the interface my.becode.org. [Instruction manual](https://github.com/becodeorg/BeCode/blob/master/procedure-mybecode.md)

In that order :

- you warn BeCode via [my.becode.org](https://my.becode.org/)
- if you already have your legal written justificatio, send it directly,
- if you know that you will have your proof later, warn when you encode your absence that you will have your justification and send it  via the interface as soon as you have it.
- if you know that you will not have any justification, warn us that you will not have any.

**Quick reminder**:

- 2 unjustified delays (or early departure) will be counted as absence;
- 2 absences will lead to an individual interview;
- 6 unjustified absences will result in permanent exclusion;

## Teaching material

- [Tutorials](/Tutorials) : These tutorials were designed to be done alone. They mix theory with practice, so as to help you grow quickly and reach a level where we can leave you to continue learning by doing on your own. They are created by your coaches. Never hesitate to follow them several times. Repetition is key.  
- [Projects & exercices](/Projects) : these projects were designed to explore well-known coding challenges and learn by doing. You'll find plenty of help online and among your teammates.
- [Missions](/Missions) : external projects coming from real clients.
